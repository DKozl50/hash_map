# HashMap

This is a `std::unordered_map` alternative implementation made for my Algorithms course.

`hash_map.h` contains the HashMap class realized as a `std::vector` of `std::list` containing pairs of `<KeyType, ValueType>`  ([Separate chaining with linked lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Separate_chaining_with_linked_lists)).

Unfortunately, it was required to write code in C++11 standarts.
